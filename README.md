# Django_Projects
This repo contains my Django projects.  

I have built this simple website as a start and deployed it on Pythonanywhere.com. It is clone of how a blog would work. Although, it is not a full-fledged blogging website, I got a great start at understanding many features of Django web framework. Check out the website at the below link.
