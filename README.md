# Django_Projects
This repo contains my Django projects.  

I have built this simple website as a start. It is clone of how a blog would work. Although, it is not a full-fledged blogging website, I got a great start at understanding many features of Django web framework. Only admin can login to post blogs on this site. Check out the website at the below link.  

I added my second project - a social media page clone. This site allows multiple users to sign up, create groups and posts. Unlike the first project, this project is made up of 3 applications.
